    "## Scrapy\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the other Python packages we have used so far, scrapy comes with its own API. While we haven't covered API's just yet, what that means practically is that scrapy makes it easy to write and debug spiders (the little programs that crawl/scrape the website).  You can also run scrapy in the command line or jupyter notebook.  For ease of illustration, the examples we use will be in the jupyter notebook.  If you want to pursue scraping further, we enourage you to use the [API](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html). You can also see an example of a project that uses that API [here](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/examples.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will write a scraper to pull data from the [_Everyday Sexism Project_](https://everydaysexism.com/), which has been collecting stories about times people have experienced or observed sexism since 2012. User-provided entries are stored and displayed as simple text entries, with user-provided categories. There is no API or other apparent method to access the data aside from the webpage, and experiences of sexism are so subjective that it is difficult to imagine getting similar-quality information through a questionnaire or other easy-to-analyse data collection method. Yet as presented, it isn’t possible to see any overarching trends beyond the sheer quantity of entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data scientist with a specific interest in learning more about experiences of sexism might want to write a scraper for the _Everyday Sexism Project_. A good scraper will pull data from every page of the ESP website. We want to save the entry text, any category labels, date posted, and the name provided by the poster. Our scraper will scrape each page, then find the URL for the previous page and call itself again for that page.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Scraper\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple scraper that just saves the entire webpage as an HTML file.  Note that Scrapy is built on top of the [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) [reactor](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35111265/how-does-pythons-twisted-reactor-work) which is event-driven and cannot be restarted within a session. What this means for us is that after each time you run a Scrapy script example here, you'll need to restart the kernel before you run another Scrapy script. Just another reason to use scrapy in the command line...\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Scrapy-made scraper, you provide one or more starting URLs. The scraper then sends a request to the server for the information at that URL. The server provides a response, which is either the information requested or an error code. Scrapy then processes the response in accordance with the instructions you've given it."

You'll need to get familiar with the structure of your document and the code that identifies the piece(s) of the web page you want. To see the code for an entry on www.everydaysexism.com, open the page in the web browser of your choice and hover over the brownish background rectangle that defines an entry.  Left-click, then select \"Inspect Element\" or some variant- [the terminology will vary depending on your browser](https://victorfont.com/how-to-use-your-browsers-inspect-tool/). In Chrome, the command is \"Inspect\". This will display your browser's developer tools alongside or below the rendered web page. The \"Elements\" tab of your developer tools will show the code for the page. The particular element you left-clicked on will be highlighted. As you move around in the code, different parts of the webpage will be highlighted, letting you know what that piece of code refers to.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Inspecting web page elements](assets/developer_tools.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've done it right, your click should have highlighted code starting with `<article id=\"post-`.  Each submission on the page is contained within an `<article>` element. Nested within each article is a `<header>` element, a `<section>` element (with the class `\"entry-content\"`), and a `<footer>` element.  Look and click around a bit and see if you can find the information we want to extract from each submission: (1) The author, (2) the date it was posted, (3) the text content, and (4) any tags associated with it. We're lucky that every submission has a standardized format, so we can use the code for this one submission as a template to build our scraper's parsing instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we get the information out of the HTML code and into our parser?  Often, people just learning to scrape think \"a ha! I will use regular expressions to pick out what I want!\"  This [is not a good idea](https://blog.codinghorror.com/parsing-html-the-cthulhu-way/) in most cases. HTML is a context-based language – the content described by any given HTML tag depends on where that tag is positioned relative to all other tags, and where that tag is opened and closed. Regex, on the other hand, ignores context. It goes along until it finds the conditions you've described and grabs the material there, ignoring everything else.  Combining HTML and regex creates [fragile code that breaks easily](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6751105/why-its-not-possible-to-use-regex-to-parse-html-xml-a-formal-explanation-in-la).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are context-aware parsers for HTML and XML that allow you to find what you need within the code without a headache.  Scrapy can work with any parser you provide, and natively incorporates two \"selectors\": [CSS-based and Xpath](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/selectors.html). We'll be using [Xpath](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp) here: It treats nested code like computer file paths, with each level referred to as a 'node' (eg. C:\\\\User\\Desktop\\Stuff for files, \\\\body\\header\\p for code).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Xpath expression to find the title of a submission in our page is: `//article/header/h2/a/@title`.  In English, this means:  \n",
    "\n",
    " * `//article`: _Locate every_ `article` _node in the page._\n",
    " * `/header`: _Find the_ `header` _node nested directly underneath the_ `article` _node._  \n",
    " * `/h2`: _Find the_ `h2` _node nested directly underneath the_ `header` _node_.  \n",
    " * `/a`: _Find the_ `a` _node nested directly underneath the_ `h2` _node._  \n",
    " * `/@title`: _Find the_ `title` _attribute within the_ `a` _node._  \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn Xpath is to try it out.  You can easily experiment using [this XPath tester](http://www.freeformatter.com/xpath-tester.html)."

    "\n",
    "As we saw in the previous example, Scrapy writes information to a file.  But raw HTML isn't very useful. Here, we will use the [JSON file format](https://blog.datafiniti.co/4-reasons-you-should-use-json-instead-of-csv-2cac362f1943). JSON stores data in a format that looks a lot like Python dictionaries. This is nice for scraping where you are likely to get non-flat data (also called semi-structured data), where rows can have different numbers of columns. JSON files are also easy to read back into Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're running Scrapy in a script, we need to call an instance of the CrawlerProcess class to actually run our scrapers. (In the API, this is taken care of automatically.) We can pass arguments into the class call that will give instructions to the scrapers, such as where to store the data (in this case, a JSON file called `firstpage.json`).\n",
